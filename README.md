# Portfolio project using Nodejs, Express, and PUG

This was great exercise to help solidify my understanding of the express framework, middleware and route concepts, and PUG templating.

A simple portfolio project that displays a grid of projects that dynamically display based on the data.json file.

## Style.css Changes/Additions
- Changed Font to Helvetica across the project
- Added box-shadows to all project thumbnails
- Hover animation added to project thumbnails
- Changed color pallete of entire project
